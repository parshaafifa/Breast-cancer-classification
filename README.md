Breast cancer tumor classification using deep learning
# Tumor Classification Using Machine Learning

This project classifies breast cancer tumors as **Malignant** or **Benign** using machine learning. The model takes 30 input features extracted from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

- **Input**: 30 real-valued features
- **Output**: Predicted tumor class (0 = Malignant, 1 = Benign)
- **Model**: Pre-trained classifier (e.g., Neural Network or Random Forest)
- **Tools**: Python, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (optional)
